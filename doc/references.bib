                  between the sentence processing mechanism and the available
                  computational resources. This theory – the Syntactic
                  Prediction Locality Theory (SPLT) – has two components: an
                  integration cost component and a component for the memory cost
                  associated with keeping track of obligatory syntactic
                  requirements. Memory cost is hypothesized to be quantified in
                  terms of the number of syntactic categories that are necessary
                  to complete the current input string as a grammatical
                  sentence. Furthermore, in accordance with results from the
                  working memory literature both memory cost and integration
                  cost are hypothesized to be heavily influenced by locality (1)
                  the longer a predicted category must be kept in memory before
                  the prediction is satisfied, the greater is the cost for
                  maintaining that prediction; and (2) the greater the distance
                  between an incoming word and the most local head or dependent
                  to which it attaches, the greater the integration cost. The
                  SPLT is shown to explain a wide range of processing complexity
                  phenomena not previously accounted for under a single theory,
                  including (1) the lower complexity of subject-extracted
                  relative clauses compared to object-extracted relative
                  clauses, (2) numerous processing overload effects across
                  languages, including the unacceptability of multiply
                  center-embedded structures, (3) the lower complexity of
                  cross-serial dependencies relative to center-embedded
                  dependencies, (4) heaviness effects, such that sentences are
                  easier to understand when larger phrases are placed later and
                  (5) numerous ambiguity effects, such as those which have been
                  argued to be evidence for the Active Filler Hypothesis."

  abstract        = {There is a wealth of evidence showing that increasing the
                  distance between an argument and its head leads to more
                  processing effort, namely, locality effects; these are usually
                  associated with constraints in working memory (DLT: Gibson,
                  2000; activation-based model: Lewis and Vasishth, 2005). In
                  SOV languages, however, the opposite effect has been found:
                  antilocality (see discussion in Levy et al., 2013).
                  Antilocality effects can be explained by the expectation-based
                  approach as proposed by Levy (2008) or by the activation-based
                  model of sentence processing as proposed by Lewis and Vasishth
                  (2005). We report an eye-tracking and a self-paced reading
                  study with sentences in Spanish together with measures of
                  individual differences to examine the distinction between
                  expectation- and memory-based accounts, and within
                  memory-based accounts the further distinction between DLT and
                  the activation-based model. The experiments show that (i)
                  antilocality effects as predicted by the expectation account
                  appear only for high-capacity readers; (ii) increasing
                  dependency length by interposing material that modifies the
                  head of the dependency (the verb) produces stronger
                  facilitation than increasing dependency length with material
                  that does not modify the head; this is in agreement with the
                  activation-based model but not with the expectation account;
                  and (iii) a possible outcome of memory load on low-capacity
                  readers is the increase in regressive saccades (locality
                  effects as predicted by memory-based accounts) or,
                  surprisingly, a speedup in the self-paced reading task; the
                  latter consistent with good-enough parsing (Ferreira et al.,
                  2002). In sum, the study suggests that individual differences
                  in working memory capacity play a role in dependency
                  resolution, and that some of the aspects of dependency
                  resolution can be best explained with the activation-based
                  model together with a prediction component.}

                  2014) that treating a result as publishable just because the
                  p-value is less than 0.05 leads to overoptimistic expectations
                  of replicability. These effects get published, leading to an
                  overconfident belief in replicability. We demonstrate the
                  adverse consequences of this statistical significance filter
                  by conducting seven direct replication attempts (268
                  participants in total) of a recent paper (Levy & Keller,
                  2013). We show that the published claims are so noisy that
                  even non-significant results are fully compatible with them.
                  We also demonstrate the contrast between such small-sample
                  studies and a larger-sample study; the latter generally yields
                  a less noisy estimate but also a smaller effect magnitude,
                  which looks less compelling but is more realistic. We
                  reiterate several suggestions from the methodology literature
                  for improving current practices.}

  abstract        = {There is a growing body of evidence showing that
                  conversational implicatures are rapidly accessed in
                  incremental utterance interpretation. To date, studies showing
                  incremental access have focussed on implicatures related to
                  linguistic triggers, such as ‘some’ and ‘or’. We discuss three
                  kinds of on-line model that can account for this data. A model
                  built around the notion of linguistic alternatives stored in
                  the lexicon would only account for linguistically triggered
                  implicatures of the kind already studied and not so-called
                  ‘particularised’ implicatures that are not associated with
                  specific linguistic items. A second model built around the
                  idea of focus alternatives could handle both linguistically
                  triggered implicatures and so-called particularised
                  implicatures but would be insensitive to the role that
                  information about the speaker’s mental state plays in deriving
                  implicatures. A third more fully ‘Gricean’ model takes account
                  of the speaker’s mental state in accessing these implications.
                  In this paper we present a visual world study using a new
                  interactive paradigm where two communicators (one confederate)
                  describe visually-presented events to each other as their eye
                  movements are monitored. In this way, we directly compare the
                  suitability of these three kinds of model. We show hearers can
                  access contextually specific particularised implicatures in
                  on-line comprehension. Moreover, we show that in doing so,
                  hearers are sensitive to the relevant mental states of the
                  speaker. We conclude with a discussion of how a more ‘Gricean’
                  model may be developed and of how our findings inform a
                  long-standing debate on the immediacy of on-line perspective
                  taking in language comprehension.}

                  in motivating cue-based models of memory retrieval during
                  language comprehension. One example of interference comes from
                  illusions of grammaticality, where ungrammatical sentences are
                  perceived as grammatical (e.g. ‘the key to the cabinets were
                  rusty’). While such effects indicate interference influences
                  perception of sentence grammaticality, less is known about how
                  interference influences the semantic interpretation assigned
                  to a sentence. We report two reading experiments that
                  manipulated sentence plausibility, rather than grammaticality,
                  as a diagnostic of interference. In both experiments, although
                  reading times were longer for implausible sentences, this
                  plausibility effect was reliably attenuated when a distractor
                  item partially matched the cues at retrieval. We interpret
                  these results as being compatible with the predictions of
                  cue-based parsing. The illusions of plausibility that we
                  report indicate that similarity-based retrieval interference
                  has a potent influence on the semantic interpretation that is
                  assigned to a sentence during processing.}

                  eye-tracking record of 10 participants reading 51,000 words of
                  newspaper text. Our results show that DLT integration cost is
                  not a significant predictor of reading times for arbitrary
                  words in the corpus. However, DLT successfully predicts
                  reading times for nouns. We also find evidence for integration
                  cost effects at auxiliaries, not predicted by DLT. For
                  surprisal, we demonstrate that an unlexicalized formulation of
                  surprisal can predict reading times for arbitrary words in the
                  corpus. Comparing DLT integration cost and surprisal, we find
                  that the two measures are uncorrelated, which suggests that a
                  complete theory will need to incorporate both aspects of
                  processing complexity. We conclude that eye-tracking corpora,
                  which provide reading time data for naturally occurring,
                  contextualized sentences, can complement experimental evidence
                  as a basis for theories of processing complexity.}

                  check that the subject of the current clause has the correct
                  morphological features: subject–verb agreement and reflexive
                  anaphors in English. In two eye-tracking experiments we
                  examined the impact of structurally illicit noun phrases on
                  the computation of reflexive and subject–verb agreement.
                  Experiment 1 directly compared the two dependencies within
                  participants. Results show a clear difference in the intrusion
                  profile associated with each dependency: agreement resolution
                  displays clear intrusion effects in comprehension (as found by
                  Pearlmutter et al., 1999, Wagers et al., 2009), but reflexives
                  show no such intrusion effect from illicit antecedents (Sturt,
                  2003, Xiang et al., 2009). Experiment 2 replicated the lack of
                  intrusion for reflexives, confirming the reliability of the
                  pattern and examining a wider range of feature combinations.
                  In addition, we present modeling evidence that suggests that
                  the reflexive results are best captured by a memory retrieval
                  mechanism that uses primarily syntactic information to guide
                  retrievals for the anaphor’s antecedent, in contrast to the
                  mixed morphological and syntactic cues used resolve
                  subject–verb agreement dependencies. Despite the fact that
                  agreement and reflexive dependencies are subject to a similar
                  morphological agreement constraint, in online processing
                  comprehenders appear to implement this constraint in distinct
                  ways for the two dependencies.},

                  representation theory and file change semantics. Some
                  linguistic examples are given that motivate the dynamic view
                  of meaning as information change potential as opposed to the
                  standard logical semantical view that equates meaning with
                  truth conditional content. The examples include anaphoric
                  relations within and across sentence boundaries, and epistemic
                  modalities. It is indicated how these are dealt with in
                  dynamic predicate logic and update semantics.}

                  Multivariate Analysis 97 (2006) 2177–2189] based on partial
                  correlations. The latter is based on the so-called D-vine. We
                  extend the methodology to any regular vine and study the
                  relationship between the multiple correlation and partial
                  correlations on a regular vine. We explain the onion method in

                  generating random correlation matrices from the same joint
                  distribution as the vine method. The methods are compared in
                  terms of time necessary to generate 5000 random correlation

  abstract        = {Abstract Given the replication crisis in cognitive science,
                  it is important to consider what researchers need to do in
                  order to report results that are reliable. We consider three
                  changes in current practice that have the potential to deliver
                  more realistic and robust claims. First, the planned
                  experiment should be divided into two stages, an exploratory
                  stage and a confirmatory stage. This clear separation allows
                  the researcher to check whether any results found in the
                  exploratory stage are robust. The second change is to carry
                  out adequately powered studies. We show that this is
                  imperative if we want to obtain realistic estimates of effects
                  in psycholinguistics. The third change is to use Bayesian
                  data-analytic methods rather than frequentist ones; the
                  Bayesian framework allows us to focus on the best estimates we
                  can obtain of the effect, rather than rejecting a strawman
                  null. As a case study, we investigate number interference
                  effects in German. Number feature interference is predicted by
                  cue-based retrieval models of sentence processing (Van Dyke \&
                  Lewis, 2003; Vasishth \& Lewis, 2006), but it has shown
                  inconsistent results. We show that by implementing the three
                  changes mentioned, suggestive evidence emerges that is
                  consistent with the predicted number interference effects.},

                  manipulations has been critical in distinguishing among
                  theories in cognition. It is well known that aggregating data
                  distorts functional relationships (e.g., Estes, 1956). Less
                  well appreciated is a second pitfall: Minimizing squared
                  errors (i.e., OLS regression) also distorts estimated
                  functional forms with RT data. We discuss three properties of
                  RT that should be modeled for accurate analysis and, on the
                  basis of these three properties, provide a hierarchical
                  Weibull regression model for regressing RT onto covariates.
                  Hierarchical regression model analysis of lexical decision
                  task data reveals that RT decreases as a power function of
                  word frequency with the scale of RT decreasing 11\% for every
                  doubling of word frequency. A detailed discussion of the model
                  and analysis techniques are presented as archived materials
