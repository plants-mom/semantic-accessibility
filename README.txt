This repository contains the data and the code for the analysis of the first
eye-tracking experiment (referred to as "experiment 2" in the paper) described
in the paper "Semantic accessibility and interference in pronoun resolution".
See this osf repository for details: https://osf.io/xznw7/
If you just want to examine the results feel free to download doc/models_summary.html.
This file contains all the results. If you want to reproduce the analysis, read on.

There is a default.nix file in the src dir which will make all the relevant
packages available in your shell. You have to have nix installed
(https://nixos.org/download).

Note that the file src/default.nix will also temporarily move your ~/.R/Makevars file and
restore it once you exit the shell. This is because, there were some issues with
the recommended Makevars settings and the brms version used for this project.
If you never adjusted Makevars you don't have to worry about this.

To recreate the project run in the project root:

nix-shell src/default.nix --pure

(this can take a while on its first run)

To recreate the project run in the nix-shell, in the project root:

Rscript src/01-prepare.R
Rscript src/02-regions.R
Rscript src/03-models.R
Rscript src/04-models_summary.R
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render(here::here('doc/models_summary.Rmd'), output_format = 'html_document')"

NB: this can take a long time, and your computer might run out of memory, particularly while running 03-models.R. If this happens, just re-run the file until it succeeds.
In the end you will get a file named models_summary.html in the doc directory (note that this file is currently present)
which contains all the results of the analysis.
